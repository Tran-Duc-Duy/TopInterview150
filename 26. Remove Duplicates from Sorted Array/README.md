Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,,,,,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 \* 104
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Best Solution Analysis:

The optimal solution for this problem is to use two pointers to traverse the array. One pointer (i) is used to iterate through the array, while the other pointer (j) is used to track the position where the next unique element should be placed. If the current element is different from the previous one, it is placed at the position pointed to by the j pointer, and the j pointer is incremented. The function finally returns the value of the j pointer, which is the number of unique elements.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, and the space complexity is O(1), as no additional space is used.
